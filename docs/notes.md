## Concepts
* cycles? especially in dungeons, reduce backtracking to a minimum
	-> "shortcuts" in walls (levers, etc.) always feel nice

## Golden path
* do not spawn "exceptional" tiles in the golden path (no blues in picture)
* place important things on the golden path
* hide bonuses away from golden path (example second level D2 with golden chest)

## Generation
* we want to limit "exceptional" tiles to max 1-2 in zone.
	-> probably pre-generate all colors for all walls to ensure this.
* walls generated by bin packing, taking from a shared pool to ensure the limits
* we could always add "1" length segments to fill in the gaps (if bin packing does not work well)
